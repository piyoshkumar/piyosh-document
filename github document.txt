 Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to 
 collaborate on software development projects. It tracks changes in your codebase, makes it
 easy to collaborate, and helps you manage different versions of your code.

Basic Commands:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone <repository_url>: Clone an existing repository to your local machine.
git add <filename>: Stage changes for commit.
git commit -m "Commit message": Commit your changes.
git push: Push your committed changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Pull changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
git status: Check the status of your repository.
